# reactdamuonsite

Damuon Insurance Brokerage Website built with React and Vite.

## Development

This project uses Vite for fast bundling and hot module reloading. To spin it up locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

When you are ready for production, build the optimized bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

Linting rules follow the default Vite React template. Feel free to extend the ESLint configuration to match your team standards.
